# Waffle

Bowuigi's game engine using [Lua](https://lua.org) for scripting games quickly and easily, made with POSIX C99

Currently a WIP

Waffle is meant to be packaged as easy as possible, so you only need these things:

- The **waffle** binary (can have any name, including the name of the game)
- An **src** folder containing main.lua
- A **lib** folder containing the necessary waffle libraries (it can contain yours too)
- The folder **LICENSES**, which contains all of the licenses used in waffle and its dependencies (it should also contain yours)

The file tree, for a game called *your_game* would look like this:

```
your_game/
	your_game (waffle but renamed)
	src/
		main.lua
		lib/
			libglad.so (required to make the gui library)
			libglfw.so (required to make the gui library)
			waffle/
				*all of the waffle libraries*
			libwaffle_gui.so
		LICENSES/
			lua_license
			glfw_license
			waffle_license
			your_game_license
```

And that is it!

While that might seem like a lot of files, most are generated by the makefile, so updating waffle (or its dependencies) is usually very simple.

This is due to its modularity and the way things work.

You don't even need the **waffle** binary, as long as you set **package.path** and **package.cpath** correctly

Dependencies
---

- Lua 5.4.3 ([get it here](https://www.lua.org/download.html))
- glad/gl C 3.3 core  ([get it here](https://glad.dav1d.de/#language=c&specification=gl&api=gl%3D3.3&api=gles1%3Dnone&api=gles2%3Dnone&api=glsc2%3Dnone&profile=core&loader=on&localfiles=on))
- glfw 3.3.4 ([get it here](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.3.4/glfw-3.3.4.zip))

All of those are bundled with waffle, so just running `make` should generate a `your_game` folder that contains the above said folder structure
